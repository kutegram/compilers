# planb.agent module

'''
The agent module encapsulates all the knowledge about the environment in which
build targets are being created and used.

Scripts communicate with the environment (and possibly each other) by creating
an instance of the agent.Connect object.

Where data comes from (such as the values of build parameters) and how the
build is actually scheduled and executed are completely hidden.

Think of this module as a database of build targets: it can be used to set up
the targets but it does not execute the build itself. You are describing the
build but doing the build is Raptor's job.
