.anno files can contain differently formatted tags. In particular, when 
reading data from them, Raptor must handle the following cases for a 
certain XML element containing a duration. That is, Raptor must handle the 
cases

<metric name="duration">93</metric>

and

<metric name="duration">93.000000</metric>

Since this may vary between the .anno files, a float conversion must be used 
first in all cases, before an int conversion. This fix implements the extra 
float conversion without which an exception occurs.
