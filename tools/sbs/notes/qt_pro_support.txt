Qt .pro file Support
---------------------

This feature is under developement and may not work as expected in a number of situations.

The "--qtpro <filename.pro>" option causes Raptor to build Qt projects directly without
having to use qmake to generate bld.inf and mmp files first.

It does this by running qmake itself automatically.

For any ".pro" file such as "XXX.pro" raptor will generate a bld.inf in the same directory 
and then use it to build the project.

Limitations:
1) Does not yet work with the parallel parsing option (-pp=on)
2) There is no support for system definitions which have ".pro" components listed in them.
3) There is no support for cleaning up the files that qmake generates.
