There is a new log filter to generate a comma-separated-values (.csv) file
listing all the errors, warnings, remarks etc. For example,

sbs --filters=csv -f name

will produce an output file "name.csv" in the current directory.

Text in the Raptor logs is classified as Error, Critical, Warning or Remark
using the list of regular expressions in the file,

SBS_HOME/lib/config/logfile_regex.csv

but this can be overriden by placing a file of the same name in the kit in
its EPOCROOT/epoc32/sbs_config folder. This is exactly the same mechanism
used by the HTML filter.

The output .csv file can be sorted and then compared (using tools like diff
or a spreadsheet viewer) to the results of a previous build.

The format of the .csv file is: type,component,configuration,text

where,

* type is one of (ok, error, critical, warning, remark, missing)
* component is the full path to the related bld.inf
* configuration is the raptor build config name (e.g. armv5_urel)
* text is the command run and its output (from the <recipe> element)

Sometimes you may want to exclude some types of message from the .csv file.
If the logs are very large you probably don't want to compare all the "ok"
lines. So a list of message types to *ignore* can be passed as a parameter
to the filter. For example,

sbs --filters=csv[ok,remark] -f name

will produce a .csv file without any "ok" or "remark" lines.
