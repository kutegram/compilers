Running Raptor Using the 'sbs' Command
---------------------------------------

Raptor is started from the commandline using the "sbs" command.  From the
windows cmd shell prompt this causes "sbs.bat" to be executed and from
the bash shell (on Windows or Linux) the "sbs" shellscript is executed.
The python components of Raptor are then started up by whichever of
these two scripts is run.

Raptor needs to be able to find its supporting files, e.g. configuration
files and python components. The SBS_HOME environment variable is used
to locate these.

e.g. on Windows one might type "set SBS_HOME=c:\apps\sbs"  or for
bash one might type "export SBS_HOME=~/sbs" depending on where one had
installed Raptor.


Automatic SBS_HOME Detection
-----------------------------

As a convenience, if the SBS_HOME is not set then the sbs startup
scripts will try to guess it - they normally reside in SBS_HOME/bin
so they assume that SBS_HOME is the directory one up from where they
themselves are located.  This makes it easier to set up Raptor as one only
has to add the raptor "/bin" directory to the user's PATH environment
variable - something that has to be done anyhow.
