It can happen that a bld.inf has PRJ_EXPORTS which have drive letters in both 
upper and lower case. For example, a bld.inf might have contents as follows:

----------------------------
PRJ_PLATFORMS
ARMV5 WINSCW

PRJ_EXPORTS
foo.txt z:/foo.txt
bar.txt Z:/bar.txt
----------------------------

In previous versions of Raptor, the following exports result:

$EPOCROOT/epoc32/data/z/foo.txt
$EPOCROOT/epoc32/release/winscw/udeb/z/foo.txt
$EPOCROOT/epoc32/release/winscw/urel/z/foo.txt
$EPOCROOT/epoc32/data/Z/bar.txt
$EPOCROOT/epoc32/release/winscw/udeb/Z/bar.txt
$EPOCROOT/epoc32/release/winscw/urel/Z/bar.txt

Notice the z and Z directories under the directories

$EPOCROOT/epoc32/release/winscw/udeb/
$EPOCROOT/epoc32/release/winscw/urel/
$EPOCROOT/epoc32/data/

This is a problem on Linux, since the directories "z" and "Z" are different.
The fix is to make the drive letter lower case in the target drive exports.
