* This is all somewhat tortured because ANSI C says that stdio.h is not supposed 
* to define va_list: it needs to have access to that data type, but must not use that name.
* Instead stdio.h should use an __ name, which is safe because it is reserved for 
* the implementation.  Hence __e32_va_list.
