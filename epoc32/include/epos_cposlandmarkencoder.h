/**
*  Class used for encoding landmark content.
*
*  When creating an instance of this class, the type (e.g. the mime type) of
*  the landmark content must be specified. The client will then receive an
*  encoder implementation which understands the requested landmark content.
*
*  Output is written either to a buffer or to a file.
*
*  The basic protocol for encoding is to 
*  -# define where to write the output to by calling @ref SetUseOutputBufferL or 
*  @ref SetOutputFileL, 
*  -# optionally add collection data using @ref AddCollectionDataL,
*  -# add landmark data to encode by using functions in @ref CPosLandmarkEncoder
*  and/or @ref CPosLandmarkDatabase::ExportLandmarksL 
*  -# finalize the encoding by calling @ref FinalizeEncodingL. 
*
*  If this protocol is not followed
*  the client is panicked with error code @p EPosLmProtocolBreak. Encoding can
*  be performed multiple times using the same encoder object.
*
*  If @ref CPosLandmarkEncoder is used, the client must call the global
*  function @ref ReleaseLandmarkResources before terminating, in order to
*  release all used landmark resources, otherwise the client may receive
*  an ALLOC panic.
