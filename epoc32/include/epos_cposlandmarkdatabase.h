/**
*  Handle to a landmark database.
*
*  This class contains functions for creating, iterating, reading, modifying
*  and deleting landmarks.
*
*  Operations on the database may fail with error code @p KErrCorrupt if the
*  database is damaged. The client can try to recover the database by calling
*  @ref CPosLandmarkDatabase::InitializeL().
*
*  Operations on the database may fail with error code @p KErrLocked if another
*  client is writing to the database. Write operations can also fail with this
*  error code if another client is currently reading from the database.
*
*  If @ref CPosLandmarkDatabase is used, the client must call the global
*  function @ref ReleaseLandmarkResources() before terminating in order to
*  release all used landmark resources, otherwise the client may receive
*  an ALLOC panic.
*
*  @p NetworkServices capability is required for remote databases.
*
*  @since S60 3.0
*  @lib eposlandmarks.lib.
