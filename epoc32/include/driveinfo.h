// CLASS DECLARATION
/**
* Class holds the drive information of the system. Platform Environment API provides 
* interface for quering the drive information of the system. Methods provided by the API should be
* used instead of the hard coded drive identifiers. 
* The API consist of the DriveInfo class, PathInfo class and system paths are defined
* in PathConfiguration.hrh. The PathInfo class is defined in PathInfo.h.
*
* Usage:
*
* @code
*  #include <DriveInfo.h>
*
*  // Get the drive identifier of the default removable mass storage.
*  TInt drive;
*  User::LeaveIfError( DriveInfo::GetDefaultDrive(
*      DriveInfo::EDefaultRemovableMassStorage, drive ) );
*
*  // 'drive' contains now the drive identifier of the default removable mass storage.
*
*  // Get the drive status of the default removable mass storage.
*  TUint status;
*  User::LeaveIfError( DriveInfo::GetDriveStatus( fs, drive, status ) );
*
*  // 'status' contains now the drive status of the default removable mass storage.
*
*  // Get all drives that are visible to the user in TDriveList.
*  TDriveList driveList;
*  TInt driveCount;
*  User::LeaveIfError( DriveInfo::GetUserVisibleDrives( fs, driveList, driveCount ) );
*
*  // 'driveList' contains now the user visible drives.
*  // 'driveCount'contains now the drive count i.e. number of non zero items in driveList.
*
*  // Access the drives stored in 'driveList'
*  TInt driveListLen( driveList.Length() ); // The length of 'driveList'
*  for( TInt i( 0 ); i < driveListLen; ++i )
*      {
*      if ( driveList[ i ] ) // Non zero items are valid drives
*          {
*          // 'i' contains drive identifier specified by TDriveNumber
*          // ...
*          }
*      }
*
*  // Get all drives that are visible to the user in DriveInfo::TDriveArray.
*  DriveInfo::TDriveArray driveArray;
*  User::LeaveIfError( DriveInfo::GetUserVisibleDrives( fs, driveArray ) );
*
*  // 'driveArray' contains now the user visible drives.
*
*  // Access the drives stored in 'driveArray'
*  driveCount = driveArray.Count() ); // The number of drives stored in 'driveArray'
*  for( TInt i( 0 ); i < driveCount; ++i )
*      {
*      TDriveNumber drive( driveArray[ i ] ); // The drive identifier at position 'i'
*      TChar driveLetter( driveArray.LetterAt( i ) ); // The drive letter at position 'i'
*      // ...
*      }
