/**
* CSensrvChannelConditionSet represents a set of conditions. A condition set is a container for one
* or more conditions.
* 
* The data type of the value contained in each Condition, in a Condition Set, must have the same data type
* as the data for the channel to which it is added. By default this should be a packaged data object of
* the channel. See the channel specific headers in \epoc32\include\sensors\channels. If the channel type
* requires a different type of value, that must be indicated clearly in the channel specific header
* defining the channel.
* 
* The channel condition set combines channel conditions with either an AND-operator or an OR-operator. In
* an AND-set, all conditions need to be met by single data item before a condition set is met. In an
* OR-set, a single condition in the set needs to be met before a condition set is met. Certain condition
* types (range conditions) require two condition objects (upper and lower limit) in a condition set for
* the set to be valid.
* 
* The pair of conditions must both have the same index in the condition set and they are considered a
* single channel condition.
