/**
*  Instant Messaging API class
*  By creating this class the user automatically connects to the Symbian server
*  but to do something reasonable the IM interface has to be created using 
*  this class. The following order of calling the methods is one possibility to 
*  use this class:
*  1. NewL() - instantiate the object
*  2. RegisterObserverL() - register the observer methods
*  3. LoginL() - connect to the protocol stack and login to remote IM server
*  4. CreateImClientL() - get the IM interface
*
*  All the error codes are returned using the leave mechanism.
