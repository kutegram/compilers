class CClickMaker: public CBase
/** Key or pointer click plug-in provider interface.

This class should be implemented by a plug-in DLL in order to produce a sound 
when a key is pressed, a key auto repeats or when the screen is tapped with 
a pointer. When any of these events occur, the window server informs the plug-in 
DLL, which can then make the sound.

The details of the event are also passed to the plug-in so that the sound 
can be tailored to the precise event, for example clicking on different keys on the 
keypad or on different parts of the screen could make different sounds.

The name of the initial plug-in to use can be specified in the wsini.ini configuration 
file using the KEYCLICKPLUGIN or KEYCLICKPLUGINFIXED keywords. When the operating 
system boots, wsini.ini is read for the name of this plug-in. If a plug-in 
name exists, the window server will try to load it. At a later time, any client 
of the window server can request a new plug-in to be loaded or the current 
one to be unloaded, using the RSoundPlugIn class.

The plug-in is a polymorphic DLL which implements the CClickMaker interface. 
Its first UID is KDynamicLibraryUidValue and its second UID is 0x10004F63. 
Its first exported function should create an object of the CClickMaker sub-class 
and should have the following signature:

EXPORT_C CClickMaker* CreateClickMakerL()

	The iParentPosition data member of aEvent is not the position of the pointer 
	event relative to origin of the parent window. Instead it is the position 
	on the screen. This is because the parent window has no meaning inside the 
	plug-in as it does to the window server client and also knowledge 
	of the screen position may be useful to the plug-in.

	to get the data:
	EEventPointer: cast to TPointerEventData*
	EEventScreenDeviceChanged: TClickMakerData*
	EEventGroupWindowOpen: TGroupWindowOpenData*
	EEventGroupWindowClose: TInt (the identifier of the window group being closed)
	EEventWindowClose: TWindowCloseData*

	@param aType One of the above listed values, in future may be used with other values.
	@param aParam See above. */

	by this function.
	
	The return value can be generated either by returning it from the function 
	or by leaving with the value. In either case, the client will get back the 
	value concerned.
	
	@param aOpcode Opcode understood by both the window server client and the
