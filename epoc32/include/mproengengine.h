/**
*  Profile engine interface.

*  How to use:
*  @code
*  // Create profile engine by using Factory:
*  MProEngEngine* profileEngine = NewEngineL();
*
*  // Free resources with MProEngEngine::Release();
*  profileEngine->Release();
*  // or if you release resources in destructor:
*  if( iEngine )
*      {
*      iEngine->Release();
*      }
*
*  // If you put this class to CleanupStack then use void CleanupReleasePushL()
*     CleanupReleasePushL( *profileEngine );
*  @endcode
