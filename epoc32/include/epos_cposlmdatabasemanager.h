/**
*  This class is used to manage landmark databases.
*
*  @p CPosLmDatabaseManager contains functions for listing registering,
*  unregistering, creating, deleting, copying landmark databases, etc.
*  It also has functions for managing the default landmark database. The
*  client can listen to events related to database management.
*
*  A database is local if it resides in the phone or in some device which
*  is mapped to the phones file system. If a database is not local, it is
*  remote.
*
*  The client refers to a database by URI. The URI consists of a protocol
*  specifier and the database location: "protocol://location". If the
*  client does not specify a protocol, "file://" is assumed.
*
*  For local landmark databases, the URI consists of the drive and the
*  database file name, e.g. "c:landmarks.ldb". The path cannot be specified
*  by the client. The extension of the database file name must be "ldb".
*  If a path is included or if the file name extension is not .ldb",
*  the client receives the error code @p KErrArgument. For local landmark
*  databases, the client receives the error code @p KErrBadName if the
*  file name is invalid and @p KErrNotReady if the drive specified in the URI
*  does not exist.
*
*  If the client specifies a local database URI and does not specify the drive
*  letter, e.g. "landmarks.ldb", default database drive is assumed.
*
*  Local databases are created by calling @ref CreateDatabaseL. "Bookmarks"
*  to remote databases are created by calling @ref RegisterDatabaseL. After
*  this they are listed by the database manager.
*
*  If @ref CPosLmDatabaseManager is used, the client must call the global
*  function @ref ReleaseLandmarkResources before terminating, in order to
*  release all used landmark resources, otherwise the client may receive
*  an ALLOC panic.
