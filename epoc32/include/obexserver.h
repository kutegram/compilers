/** OBEX server.

CObexServer provides a framework for servicing OBEX requests from remote clients. 
It is designed to be able to act as either a "default" application (in IrDA 
terms, registering on the IrDA:OBEX IAS class), or as a application specific 
server (registering itself on a private IAS class). 

You implement service-specific behaviour by providing a MObexServerNotify 
interface implementation to the server object. The server calls the interface's 
functions to provide notification of server events, which specific implementations 
can process (or ignore) as appropriate.

This class is not designed for user derivation.
