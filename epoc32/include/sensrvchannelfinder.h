/**
* The CSensrvChannelFinder class provides an API that allows clients to discover the sensor
* channels supported by Sensor Services and receive notifications when channels are installed
* and uninstalled.
* 
* The channel specific header files e.g. for orientation, acceleration, proximity, will document
* whether a secure id, vendor id or a set of capabilities, if any, is required by the client to
* be able to view a channel or receive notifications for it. See the channel specific header
* files for these requirements.
* 
* On instantiation of this class a session connection to the Sensor Server is made. The Sensor
* server is a transient server and is started, if not already running, when a session connection
* is made. The sensor server is shutdown when a device-configured timeout period expires after
* the last session connection has been dropped. The Sensor Server will not shutdown if there is
* a session connection to it.
* 
* Each item in RSensrvChannelInfoList returned by FindChannelsL() contains a channel Id which is
* only valid for the lifetime of the sensor server. If a client requires that this id remains
* unchanged then the client must ensure that an instance of either CSensrvChannelFinder or
* CSensrvChannel remains instantiated. This keeps a session connection with the server open which
* prevents the sensor server from shutting down.
