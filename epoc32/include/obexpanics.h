This file contains details of all OBEX and OBEX Transport panics which may be raised
as a result programming error by the users of OBEX (e.g. Client or Server Application
or a proprietry transport controller).

Internal panic codes should not be raised due to user errors but would reflect
internal Obex programming errors - see inc/obexfaults.h
