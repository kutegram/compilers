/**
*  This class is used to perform searches for landmarks or landmark categories
*  in a landmark database.
*
*  To search a landmark database, an instance of this class is created,
*  supplying the database to search. The client creates a criterion object to
*  specify what to search for. There are different criterion classes which all
*  inherit from @ref CPosLmSearchCriteria. For instance, the client can search
*  for landmarks which contain a certain text string by passing a
*  @ref CPosLmTextCriteria.
*
*  Some criterion classes are used for searching for landmarks (e.g.
*  @ref CPosLmCategoryCriteria is used for searching for landmarks which
*  contain a certain category) and some are used
*  to search for landmark categories (e.g. @ref CPosLmCatNameCriteria is used
*  to search for landmark categories by specifying a category name which may
*  contain wild-card characters).
*
*  Searches can be run in incremental mode.
*  @ref StartLandmarkSearchL and @ref StartCategorySearchL both return a
*  @p CPosLmOperation object which is used to execute the search. If it is
*  run incrementally the client can supervise the progress of the operation.
*  If it is sufficient to run the search synchronously, the client only has to
*  call @p CPosLmOperation::ExecuteL. The client can cancel
*  the search by deleting the @p CPosLmOperation object.
*
*  By default, these functions start a new search, but the client can specify
*  that only previous matches should be searched. This can be used to refine
*  the search when there are many matches.
*
*  During the search execution a read-lock is acquired for each database.
*
*  Only one search can be performed at a time by the single instance of
*  the class. If a search is already running, the search function leaves
*  with error code @p KErrInUse.
*
*  After search completion, the client can make a second search and specify
*  that only the matches from the previous search shall be considered.
*
*  The client can also set a limit on how many search matches should be
*  returned (see @ref SetMaxNumOfMatches).
*
*  The client retrieves the matches from the search by requesting an iterator
*  (see @ref MatchIteratorL) or by using display data (see @ref SetDisplayData).
*
*  @p NetworkServices capability is required for remote databases.
*
