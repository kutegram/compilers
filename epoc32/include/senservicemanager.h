// CLASS DECLARATION

/**
* CSenServiceManager class offers API for accessing and managing 
* WebServicesFramework (WSF) service and identity related data.
* The class is designed using abstract factory pattern: 
* it only offers a instance (pointer) to the actual implementation 
* class meeting this interface.
* Typically, service consumers use of CSenServiceManager to register service
* or identity based data, which is required for accessing some invocable, 
* possibly remote service.
* The class is meant for both default frameworks offered by WSF 
* and for any custom plug-in service invocation framework implementation.
* The default frameworks are:
*      1) Identity Based Web Services Framework (ID-WSF).
*      2) Basic Web Services Framework.
* For Basic Web Service consumer, the only applicable operations are 
* Identity data managing methods. These can be used to make connection 
* specific Basic Authentication (BASIC-AUTH) credentials available without 
* later end-user interaction. Otherwise required authentication info 
* will be requested via notifier dialog prompts.
* ID-WSF consumer has to use the CSenServiceManager methods to register 
* authentication service description and identity provider (which are 
* the same service in ID-WSF) and finally associate some actual service 
* (contract to a WSP) to this IDP.
* 
* The current client-server framework implementation of CSenServiceManager 
* is synchronous, although class inherits CActive for future extensions.
* So, the class instance will not be an active object handled 
* by ActiveScheduler, and it does not have implementation 
* in RunL() or DoCancel() methods.
*
