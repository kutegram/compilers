/**
* The CSensrvChannel class provides an API that allows clients to open, control, configure, 
* receive data and receive notifications from a sensor channel.
* 
* When instantiating CSensrvChannel an instance of TSensrvChannelInfo returned by
* CSensrvChannelFinder::FindChannelsL() must be used. This ensures that internal data used
* in identifying the chosen channel is passed back to Sensor Services in its entirety
* therefore ensuring correct operation. Not using the instance returned by
* CSensrvChannelFinder::FindChannelsL() will result in undefined behaviour.
* 
* On instantiation of this class a session connection to the Sensor Server is made. The Sensor
* server is a transient server and is started, if not already running, when a session connection
* is made. The sensor server is shutdown when a device-configured timeout period expires after
* the last session connection has been dropped. The Sensor Server will not shutdown if there is
* a session connection to it.
* 
* The instance of TSensrvChannelInfo returned by CSensrvChannelFinder::FindChannelsL()
* contains a channel Id which is only valid for the lifetime of the sensor server. If a client
* requires that this id remains unchanged then the client must ensure that an instance of either
* CSensrvChannelFinder or CSensrvChannel remains instantiated. This keeps a session connection with
* the server open which prevents the sensor server from shutting down.
* 
* After creating an instance of this class a client would typically:
* 1. Check the configuration of the channel using GetPropertyL() or GetAllPropertuies().
* 2. Change the configuration where necessary using SetPropertiesL()
* 3. If SetPropertiesL() failed, because of higher priority clients of this same channel or higher
* priority clients of impacted channels on the same sensor, listen for notifications indicating
* when it is able to set properties using SetPropertyListenerl().
* 4. Listen for property changes using SetPropertyListenerl(). This notifies the client of property
* changes made by other clients of this same channel.
* 5. Listen for data and retrieve data on the channel using StartDataListeningL() and GetData().
* 6. Set trigger conditions for a 1 off notification when the condition is met using AddConditionL()
* and SetConditionListeningL(). 
* 
* Its possible that there may be more than 1 client using the same sensor channel on the device. Each
* of these clients will have created their own instance of CSensrvChannel and can attempt to configure
* the sensor using the SetPropertyL() operation. To manage any contention between clients wishing to
* change the configuration of the sensor a concept of Client Priorities is employed. This means that a
* device creator assigns a pre-determined priority to a client. If a client has not been assigned a
* priority then it is assumed it has the lowest priority.
* 
* When the SetPropertyL() operation is called the sensor server checks to see if the client has the
* highest Client Priority of all clients using that channel or using an impacted channel on the same
* sensor. If it has the property is set and all other clients of the channel are notified of the property
* change. If it has not the SetPropertyL() operation fails with KErrAccessDenied. If clients have
* the same priority then property setting is done on a first come first served basis.
* 
* If a client is unable to set a property because of higher priority clients then the client should
* implement the MSensrvPropertyListener::SetPropertySuccessIndicationChanged() callback so that they can
* be notified when they are able to set properties.
* 
* All client applications should be designed in such a way so that they are able to handle the situation
* where they are unable to configure a channel using the SetPropertyL() operation.
* 
* For example:
* Should application features be disabled or should the application shutdown in such conditions?
* Should features be disabled under certain channel configurations?
* 
* This object is closed when deleted either by a call to operator delete or by the cleanup stack. No special
* cleanup code is necessary to close the object before deletion.

    * To use this operation clients must provide an object that inherits from MSensrvDataListener.

    * When new data is available to be read, the client is notified by the
    * MSensrvDataListener::DataReceived() callback. On receiving this notificaton the client should
    * retrieve the data using the GetData() operation.
    * 
    * Note that if a client is listening for both data and conditions on the channel then the lower
    * desired count and buffering period provided in either start listening operation arguments will be
    * used for both listeners. When either listener is stopped neither the desired count nor the
    * buffering period shall be changed.
    * 
    * For the best performance, always use the highest desired count and maximum count as the use case
    * allows. This will reduce the overhead caused by a high volume of IPC context switches. However,
    * be aware that higher counts need to reserve more memory.
    * 
    * 
    * @param  aDataListener Data listener for the channel. Must be valid until data listening is stopped. 
    * @param  aDesiredCount Desired receiving buffer size defined as a count of the channel data objects.
    *         The maximum value is determined by sensor server internal channel buffer size, and minimum
    *         value is one. Any value outside these limits is interpreted as maximum possible value.
    *         The actual count of channel data objects received may be smaller than aDesiredCount, if a
    *         non-zero buffering period has been specified.
    *         The actual count of channel data objects received may larger, if aMaximumCount is bigger
    *         than aDesiredCount.
    *         If the sensor supplies data sporadically, and the clients requires every data object then
    *         aDesiredCount should be set to one to ensure that no data objects are missed. 
    * @param  aMaximumCount Maximum receiving buffer size defined as a count of the channel data object.
    *         The Maximum value is determined by sensor server internal channel buffer size, and minimum
    *         value is aDesiredCount. Any value outside these limits is interpreted as maximum possible
    *         value.
    *         It is recommended that whenever aDesiredCount needs to be low and sensor has relatively high
    *         data rate, aMaximumCount is set to significantly higher than aDesiredCount to reduce IPC
    *         context switches and data loss.
    * @param  aBufferingPeriod Specifies the maximum time in milliseconds that sensor server waits before
    *         notifying the client that new data is available. It is possible that no new data is will be
    *         available when the client is notified.
    *         Zero timeout means that only desired and maximum counts are used in getting data.
    *         Using a buffering period results in lot of unnecessary IPC context switches if a sensor
    *         channel supplies data sporadically. It is therefore recommended that a buffering period is
    *         used only when it is absolutely vital to have data at specific intervals and using a low
