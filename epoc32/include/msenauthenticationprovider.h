*                applications can provide userinfo / account (username & password)
*                to WS-stack. This information can be used in actual authentication
*                with (remote) web service (Liberty Authentication Service or 
*                WS-* STS), or locally (in device) to allow secure access to private
*                information (like credentials to the service, etc).

* Interface description:

* The applications can register this callback interface, through which they will receive
* userinfo callbacks (when data like username and password is needed).
*
* Both Service Connection and Service Manager APIs utilize this interface.
*
* In practice, service consumer applications often integrate these callbacks to their UI 
* events, allowing them a control point end-user (login) prompts. 
*
* Furthermore, (remote) service management applications can provide identity (user account)
* spesific "secret", in order to manipulate associated credentials stored in Web Services
