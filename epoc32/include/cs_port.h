The class implements CObject to obtain reference counting behaviour. The reference 
count is incremented when a port is first created, and, for ports in shared 
mode, on every later opening.

CPort is an abstract class which defines many pure virtual functions which 
derived classes must implement. Most of these pure virtual functions correspond 
to the client interface of the RComm class.

Created when the first client does an Open request passing its name.
Destroyed only when it deletes itself (following a call to Destruct).

the factory is responsible for creating instances of CPort-derived classes

about the capabilities of the serial protocol implemented by the CSY.

Owned by the CPort object it creates.
