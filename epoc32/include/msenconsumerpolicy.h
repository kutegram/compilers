/**
*  This abstract class defines consumer policy interface.
*  The consumer policy sets the conditions in which some service provider 
*  is capable to operate in. It is defining context, through which these
*  (possibly remote) services may be contacted and used.
*  The actual properties may include transport layer settings, like 
*  predefined Internet Access Point (IAP) ID. In addition, consumer policy
*  may declare, that certain service should only be contacted using certain
*  identity provider (in ID-WSF). This can be achieved by mapping certain 
*  list of IDP IDs to a consumer policy. 
*  A consumer policy is effective only for a single session, and thus it
*  applies to one service connection only. This means, that this policy
*  information is "private", and not shared between different WSC applications
*  using WSF, event though they might be using the same (remote) service at the
*  same time. Consumer policy properties are not serialized in any WSF
*  database, but resides in memory only.
*
*   Example structure of ConsumerPolicy XML fragment:
*
*   <ConsumerPolicy>
*       <Transport>
*           <IapId>
*               2
*           </IapId>
*       </Transport>
*       <IdentityProviderIDs strict="false">
*           <IdentityProviderID>
*             urn:first.example.idp.com
*           </IdentityProviderID>
*           <IdentityProviderID>
*             urn:second.example.idp.com
*           </IdentityProviderID>
*       </IdentityProviderIDs>
*   </ConsumerPolicy>
