/**
*  This abstract class defines provider policy interface.
*  The provider policy sets the conditions in which some service provider 
*  is capable to operate in. It is defining context, through which these
*  (possibly remote) services may be contacted and used.
*  The actual properties may include transport layer settings, like 
*  predefined Internet Access Point (IAP) ID. In addition, provider policy
*  may declare, that certain service should only be contacted using certain
*  identity provider (in ID-WSF). This can be achieved by mapping certain 
*  list of IDP IDs to a provider policy. 
*  Provider Policies are WSF wide settings, which are stored in WSF
*  databases, and thus they are shared with all the actual Web Service
*  Consumers (WSCs) accessing same services.
*
*   Example structure of ProviderPolicy XML fragment:
*
*   <ProviderPolicy>
*       <Transport>
*           <IapId>
*               1
*           </IapId>
*       </Transport>
*       <IdentityProviderIDs strict="true">
*           <IdentityProviderID>
*             urn:first.id.example.com
*           </IdentityProviderID>
*           <IdentityProviderID>
*             urn:second.id.example.com
*           </IdentityProviderID>
*       </IdentityProviderIDs>
*   </ProviderPolicy>
