// CLASS DECLARATION

/**
* Class offers static methods for parsing and validating phone numbers. 
* Phone Parser API provides methods which are used to parse and validate
* phone numbers. The API consist of the CommonPhoneParser class.
*
* Examples of valid phone numbers:
* 1.	+358501234567
* 2.	+358 (50) 123 4567
*
* Even though both of the above examples are valid phone numbers, only 1) is 
* accepted as a phone number by many systems. To convert 2) to 1), use the 
* parsing method of the API.
*
*
* Usage:
*   
* @code
*  #include <commonphoneparser.h> 
*
*  // Example shows how to use the parsing method of the API.
*
*  // A number to be parsed. 
*  TBuf<50> number1 = _L("+358 (40) 123 132");
* 
*  // Type of the phone number to be parsed is a regular phone number.
*  TBool validNumber1 = 
*  CommonPhoneParser::ParsePhoneNumber( number1,
*                                       CommonPhoneParser::EPlainPhoneNumber );
*
*  // The phone number number1 is a valid regular phone number.
*  // After parsing validNumber1 is ETrue and 
*  // number1 is "+35840123132".
*  // Do something like SendSMS( number1 ) etc.
* 
*  // A number to be parsed. 
*  TBuf<50> number2 = _L("+358 (40) 123p132"); // note 'p'
* 
*  // Type of the phone number to be parsed is a regular phone number.
*  TBool validNumber2 = 
*  CommonPhoneParser::ParsePhoneNumber( number2,
*                                       CommonPhoneParser::EPlainPhoneNumber );
*
*  // The phone number number2 is not a valid regular phone number.
*  // After parsing validNumber2 is EFalse and 
*  // number2 is "+358 (40) 123p132" (unchanged).
