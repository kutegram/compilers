/**
*  Category management for a landmark database.
*
*  A landmark database can contain a number of categories which can be
*  assigned to the landmarks in the database. A landmark can be associated
*  with multiple categories, e.g. a landmark can be a "Restaurant" and a "Pub".
*  Categories also enable filtered searches, e.g. a client could search for
*  nearby restaurants.
*
*  This class contains functions for managing landmark categories. This includes
*  reading, listing, creating and updating landmark categories.
*
*  @p NetworkServices capability is required for remote databases.
