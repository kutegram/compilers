class MVersitObserver
/** A Versit parser observer.

This is a plug-in class and contains only pure virtual functions.

An implementator of this class can find out the version number of an entity 
being parsed. The version number specifies the version of the vCard/vCalendar 
specification used by the data of the vCard/vCalendar. This is for use in 
conjunction with the MVersitPlugin class, which adjusts the parser's behaviour 
according to the vCard/vCalendar version.

An implementator of this class can also respond to the creation of a new parser 
for an embedded sub-entity. This is so that the observer can set the MVersitPlugin, 
as well as itself, for each new parser that is created.

An observer is set up for a Versit parser using CVersitParser::SetObserver().

/** A Versit parser plug-in.

This is a plug-in class and contains only pure virtual functions.

An implementator of this class can override some of the low level behaviour 
of a Versit parser. For instance, options are provided to determine behaviour 
during line wrapping and unwrapping.

The use of this plug-in is optional, and when there is no plug-in the parser 
object will use default behaviour. However, vCard v3.0 has some differences 
to vCard v2.1, such as for line wrapping and unwrapping. Symbian OS supports 
vCard v2.1 in its default behaviour. Therefore this plug-in can be used to 
provide compatibility with vCard v3.0.
