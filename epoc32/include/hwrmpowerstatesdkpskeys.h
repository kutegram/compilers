* The API provides the P&S power state keys that are updated by the HW Resource 
* Manager Server. These keys provide up-to-date information on the charging 
* status, battery level and battery state of the device. Any application may 
* subscribe to these P&S keys that are updated to receive notifications of 
* any change in state.
*
* This interface relies on the Publish and Subscribe (P&S) interface provided
* by Symbian. P&S is used by HW Resource Manager to globally publish the power
* state information.
*
* The P&D UID is #KPSUidHWRMPowerState and following keys are provided:
* - #KHWRMBatteryLevel
* - #KHWRMBatteryStatus
* - #KHWRMChargingStatus
