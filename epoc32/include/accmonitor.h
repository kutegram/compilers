/**
* The Accessory Monitoring API interface offers accessory information about
* connected accessories. It also offers an easy-to-use implementation of a 
* CActive-based wrapper for accessory connection status changed event 
* notifications. The clients can get information about the connected 
* accessories capabilities and, if the capabilities have values, get the
* values from these capabilites. This API consist of classes CAccMonitor,
* CAccMonitorInfo and MAccMonitorObserver. If the user wants to use the
* observer this API offers, the user has to  implement callback function
* for receiving accessory connection and disconnection status notifications. 
* The connected accessories are offered to the client in an array. This array
* presents the connected accessories as instances of CAccMonitorInfo class.
* The CAccMonitorInfo offers accessory information encapsulated to a class. It
* presents accessory device type, physical connection and device address 
* information with basic getter functions. The rest of the accessories
* features are contained in an array. This array can be accessed with functions
* that are in CAccMonitorInfo.
* This class is not intended for user derivation.
*
* Usage:
* 
* Example query for some accessory's information. All connected accessories are
* fetched and the instance of CAccessoryInfo is getted:
* @code
* CAccMonitor* accMonitor = CAccMonitor::NewLC();
* RConnectedAccessories connectedAccessories;
* CleanupClosePushL( connectedAccessories );
* accMonitor->GetConnectedAccessoriesL( connectedAccessories );
* CAccMonitorInfo* accInfo = CAccMonitorInfo::NewLC();
* TInt countOfArray = connectedAccessories.Count();
* for( TInt i = 0; i != countOfArray; i++ )
*   {
*   TAccMonCapability deviceType = connectedAccessories[ i ]->AccDeviceType();
*   if( deviceType == KAccMonHeadset )
*     {
*     // Some Headset is connected, get the information to accInfo
*     accInfo->CopyL( connectedAccessories[ i ] );
*     }
*   }
* // Destroy the pointers from the array, because those are owned by the client
* CleanupStack::PopAndDestroy( accInfo );
* CleanupStack::PopAndDestroy( &connectedAccessories );
* CleanupStack::PopAndDestroy( accMonitor );
* @endcode
* 
* Example query for some accessorys capabilties. The user has fetched the
* CAccMonitorInfo to accInfo instance from connected accessories:
* @code
* TInt arrayCount = accInfo->Count();
* for( TInt i = 0; i != arrayCount; i++ )
*   {
*   TAccMonCapability accCapa = accInfo->AccCapabilityAtIndex( i );
*   if( accCapa == KAccMonStereoAudio )
*     {
*     // Accessory has stereo capability, handle this situation.
*     }
*   }
* @endcode
*
* Initialization example for the observer(from a class that implements
* MAccMonitorObserver interface).
* Observer starts to listen for headset connects:
* @code
* CAccMonitor* accMonitor = CAccMonitor::NewLC();
* RAccMonCapabilityArray capabilityArray;
* CleanupClosePushL( capabilityArray );
* capabilityArray.Append( KAccMonHeadset );
* accMonitor->StartObservingL( this, capabilityArray );
* CleanupStack::PopAndDestroy( &capabilityArray );
* CleanupStack::PopAndDestroy( accMonitor );
* @endcode
*
* Uninitialization example:
* @code
* accMonitor->StopObserving(); 
* @endcode
*
* Connected method implementation example:
* @code
* void CMyAccMonitorTest::Connected( CAccMonitorInfo* aAccessoryInfo )
*    {
*    // Notification about the connected accessory. aAccessoryInfo must
*    // be copied because the pointer is deleted after connected method
*    iAccessoryInfo->CopyL( aAccessoryInfo );
*    }
* @endcode
*
*
