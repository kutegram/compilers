A handle to an RR (Receiver Report) RTP packet.

An instance of this class represents the reception report of one host
about another host; it may have come from either a SR (Sender Report) or
a RR (Receiver Report) packet, which may contain
other RRs (Receiver Reports) as well.

An object of this type is returned from a call to the RRtcpRRPart
indexing operator and specifying the index of the required RR.

Note that resources accessed thorugh this handle are owned by other objects
and therefore has no Close() member function.
