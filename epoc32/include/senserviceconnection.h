// CLASS DECLARATION

/**
  * The class for connecting to service providers
  * through Web Services Framework (WSF). 
  *
  * The class offers asynchronous construction of a
  * service connection. Further, there are asynchronous
  * and synchronous interaction methods for e.g. sending 
  * and receiving data from (possibly remote) service.
  * 
  * WSF offers two default frameworks:
  *
  *   1. Identity Based Web Services Framework
  *      (ID-WSF). The framework ID for this is 
  *      KDefaultIdWsfFrameworkID ("ID-WSF").
  * 
  *   2. Basic Web Services Framework. Framework
  *      ID is KDefaultBasicWebServicesFrameworkID
  *      ("WS-I").
  * 
  * The most typical use of CSenServiceConnection
  * is to interact with a service of certain type
  * through some invocable framework and submitting
  * and receiving messages.
  *
  * In case of WebServices, the actual service is remote
  * and submitted messages are SOAP envelopes. However,
  * CSenServiceConnection supports accessing any
  * ServiceInvocationFramework which ECOM plug-in
  * implementation is present. These plug-ins may
  * further communicate with some service, including
  * local services. 
  * 
  * The link between CSenServiceConnection and any plug-in
  * implementation interacting with some service is the
  * framework ID, which is a property of ServiceDescription (SD)
  * and accessible via MSenServiceDescription interface, which
  * each SD class must implement. 
  * 
  * When creating a connection, one offers predefined SD as
  * an argument for asynchronous constructor. Or, optionally 
  * only a Liberty Alliance ID-WSF specific contract string 
  * - typically some URN. If only contract is offered, then
  * the created connection defaults to ID-WSF service and 
  * ID-WSF framework (ID) will be used.
  * 
  * The WSF further uses the offered framework ID while looking
  * up any matching framework plug-in implementation. As a
  * result the SD might be offered to several plug-ins.
