/**
The concrete session class for RemCon controllers.
Controller sessions are connectionless when opened. This means that addressing 
of commands is done by the Target Selector Plugin (TSP). A controller may 
alternatively be connection-oriented, which means that addressing of commands 
is done using a member of the server-side session which specifies a connection 
to a remote device. [NB Just because a session 'points to' a connection in 
this way does not means that the connection necessarily exists at the bearer 
level or at any other level.]
To make a controller session connection-oriented, call GoConnectionOriented. 
On success, the session's remote address member will have been set to the 
requested remote address.
To make a session connectionless again, use GoConnectionless. On success, the 
remote address member will be null, indicating that the TSP will be used to 
address our commands.
To control bearer-level connections, use ConnectBearer and DisconnectBearer. 
Note that real connections may, depending on the bearer, be torn down by the 
remote end outside of our control. Use GetConnections (and the associated 
notification) to get information about the current state of the real 
connections. Note however that the client is not _required_ to be interested 
in this level of control as RemCon is responsible for making sure the required 
connection exists at the bearer level before sending the message. The level of 
control mentioned is provided to the client so that it can, for instance, 
ensure adequate responsiveness of the first command sent.
ConnectBearerCancel and DisconnectBearerCancel merely cancel interest in the 
corresponding request. They do not change the state of the system, bearers, 
connections, or member data in any other way. They operate as pure Symbian OS 
asynchronous cancel methods.
