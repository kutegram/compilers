// CLASS DECLARATION

/**
*  This abstract class defines the interface for XML fragment classes.
*  The subclasses are used to extract certain part of XML document into
*  a separate XML subtree, called fragment. This M-class is typically used
*  when a safe reference to some actual implementation is required.
*  Fragment classes are content handlers for SAX callback events received
*  from CSenXmlReader class. They typically inherit MSenContentHandlerClient
*  to achive this.
