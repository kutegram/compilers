// CLASS DECLARATION

/**
* Class provides methods to load and format resource strings.
* String Loader API provides an interface to load and format resource strings
* that may contain parameter(s) (\%U for text or or \%N for numerical).
* Resource strings are usually defined in an RSS file.
*
* The API consists of the StringLoader class. All methods are static, so there is
* no need to explicitly allocate memory for the interface class.
* The implementation needs a CCoeEnv instance to access for example the
* resource files.
*
*
* Usage:
*
* Applications load and format resource strings from normal resources with
* static methods of the StringLoader class. The loading is done with the LoadL
* and LoadLC methods and with the Load method in situations where memory
* allocation from the heap is not possible. Formatting is done automatically
* after loading in the LoadL and LoadLC methods, but it can also be done
* separately with the Format method in situations where memory allocation from
* the heap is not possible. For reading the resource strings with the Load,
* LoadL and LoadLC methods, the user should provide a pointer to CCoeEnv for
* efficiency reasons. If the pointer is not provided, the implementation uses
* the CCoeEnv::Static method internally to get it.
*
* Different size displays can handle different length strings. To take full
* advantage of this fact, StringLoader supports resource strings with multiple
* options for string separated by 0x0001 character. Each such string can
* contain same or different sub string keys (\%U and \%N). StringLoader returns
* all strings, it is responsibility of the caller to parse the result and
* choose the proper string to display.
*
* Setting the maximum sub string length may be done in the text resources. Sub
* string maximum lengths can be localized separately for every language.
* The maximum sub string length is of the format: \%U[NN]
* where NN is a number [01..99]. Please note that NN must always consist of two
* characters, i.e. if the sub string maximum length is eight characters, the
* value to be used is 08, not plain 8. If the number of characters exceeds the
* maximum length, the sub string is cut to fit and the last character is
* replaced with an ellipsis character.
*
* The following examples describe the usage of the String Loader API.
*
* Usage when one TInt is added:
*
* @code
*  // In .loc -file
*  // #define text_example "You have %N undone tasks."
*
*  // In .rss -file
*  // RESOURCE TBUF r_text_example { buf = text_example; }
*
*  // (In the .cpp -file)
*  #include <stringloader.h>
*
*  // Get CCoeEnv instance
*  CEikonEnv* iEikonEnv = CEikonEnv::Static();
*
*  TInt number( 324 );
*
*  // Method reads a resource string with memory allocation
*  // and replaces all %N-strings in it with a replacement TInt.
*  // The heap descriptor must be destroyed when it is no longer needed.
*  // iEikonEnv is needed for loading the resource string.
*  HBufC* stringholder = StringLoader::LoadL( R_TEXT_EXAMPLE, number, iEikonEnv );
*
*  // The 'number' is added to the resource string. The result is
*  // that stringholder points to a heap descriptor containing string:
*  // "You have 324 undone tasks."
*
*  // Delete the heap descriptor
*  delete stringholder;
* @endcode
*
*
* Usage when several strings are added:
*
* Index can be included to parameters. Several parameters can have same index,
* if same replacement is needed multiple times.
*
* @code
*  // In .loc -file
*  // #define text_example "I'm %2U%1U %3U%0U fine."
*
*  // In .rss -file
*  // RESOURCE TBUF r_text_example { buf = text_example; }
*
*  // In the .cpp -file
*  #include <stringloader.h>
*
*  // Get CCoeEnv instance
*  CEikonEnv* iEikonEnv = CEikonEnv::Static();
*
*  CDesCArrayFlat* strings = new CDesCArrayFlat( 4 );
*  CleanupStack::PushL( strings );
*
*  strings->AppendL( _L("orking") ); //First string
*
*  strings->AppendL( _L("ll") ); //Second string
*
*  strings->AppendL( _L("sti") ); //Third string
*
*  strings->AppendL( _L("w") ); //Fourth string
*
*  // Method reads a resource string with memory allocation and replaces
*  // the %(index)U strings in it with replacement strings from an array.
*  // The heap descriptor must be destroyed when it is no longer needed.
*  // iEikonEnv is needed for loading the resource string.
*  HBufC* stringholder = StringLoader::LoadL( R_TEXT_EXAMPLE, *strings, iEikonEnv );
*
*  // Four strings are added to the resource string. The result is
*  // that stringholder points to a heap descriptor containing string:
*  // "I'm still working fine."
*
*  // Pop and delete strings array
*  CleanupStack::PopAndDestroy();
*
*  // Delete the heap descriptor
*  delete stringholder;
* @endcode
*
*
* Usage with scalable UI support:
*
* @code
*  // In .loc -file
*  // #define TEXT_EXAMPLE "You have missed %N messages from %U."<0x0001>"Missed %N msgs from %U."<0x0001>"Missed %N msgs."
*
*  // In .rss -file
*  // RESOURCE TBUF R_TEXT_EXAMPLE { buf = TEXT_EXAMPLE; }
*
*  // In the .cpp -file
*  #include <stringloader.h>
*
*  // Get CCoeEnv instance
*  CEikonEnv* iEikonEnv = CEikonEnv::Static();
*
*  TInt number( 12 );
*  _LIT(name, "John Doe");
*
*  // Method reads a resource string with memory allocation,
*  // replaces all %N strings in it with a replacement TInt and
*  // all %U strings in it with a replacement string.
*  // The heap descriptor must be destroyed  when it is no longer needed.
*  // iEikonEnv is needed for loading the resource string.
*  HBufC* stringholder = StringLoader::LoadL( R_TEXT_EXAMPLE, name, number, iEikonEnv );
*
*  // The number and name are added to the resource string. The result is
*  // that stringholder points to a heap descriptor containing string:
*  // "You have missed 12 messages from John Doe.\001Missed 12 msgs from John
*  // Doe.\001Missed 12 msgs."
*
*  // Delete the heap descriptor
*  delete stringholder;
* @endcode
*
*
* Error handling:
*
* The leave mechanism of the Symbian OS environment is used to handle memory
* exhaustion. The panic mechanism is used to handle programming errors while
* debugging. RStringLoader panics for seven different reasons. The panic 
* category is named STRINGLOADER. The panic codes are:
*
* - ETooFewArguments        = 0 (Unsolved parameters in resource string.)
* - ETooManyArguments       = 1 (Already solved all parameters in  resource string.)
* - EKeyStringNotFound      = 2 (The key string wasn't found in formatting.)
* - EInvalidIndex           = 3 (Invalid index in Format-method)
* - EDescriptorTooSmall     = 4 (Too small destination descriptor.)
* - ECCoeEnvNotInitialized  = 5 (CCoeEnv is not initialized)
* - EInvalidSubstitute      = 6 (Substituted string contains KSubStringSeparator)
