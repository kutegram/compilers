/**
* The class used to control the device vibra.
*
* HW Resource Manager Vibra API is a library API providing ability to control
* the device vibra. The API provides also methods to retrieve the current settings
* of the vibration feature in the user profile and the current status of the vibra. 
*
* The type of HW Resource Manager Vibra API is a synchronous method call meaning 
* the method call will block the client application. However, e.g. StartVibraL methods do 
* return right after device vibration has successfully been started. Callback is intended only
* for observing vibra and feedback on/off changes. The API is meant for all 
* applications which need to control the device vibra.
*
* The API consist of the classes CHWRMVibra, MHWRMVibraObserver and MHWRMVibraFeedbackObserver. 
* If the client requires up-to-date status information, it should also provide callback pointer
* of the MHWRMVibraObserver implementing class for the NewL-method and explicitly set feedback observer.
*
* Usage:
*
* @code
* #include <HWRMVibra.h>  // link against HWRMVibraClient.lib
*
* // A CHWRMVibra instance can be created by using NewL() or NewLC() methods. 
* // Up-to-date status information not required, no callbacks.
* CHWRMVibra* vibra = CHWRMVibra::NewL();
*
* // After this, vibra can be directly controlled via the provided class methods. 
* vibra->StartVibraL(5000); // Start vibra for five seconds
* vibra->StopVibraL(); // Immediately stop vibra
*
* // To clean up, delete the created object:
* delete vibra;
* @endcode
*
*  @lib HWRMVIBRACLIENT.DLL
*  @since S60 3.0
