This is a value between EMdaPriorityMin and EMdaPriorityMax. The higher value indicates a more 
important request. It is used to resolve conflicts when more than one client tries to access the
same hardware resource simultaneously.

One of these values is passed in the first parameter to CMdaAudioOutputStream::SetPriority().
