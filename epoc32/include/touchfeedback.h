/**
 *  This is the Tactile Feedback interface for UI Controls.
 *
 *  Provides an interface to add, modify and remove feedback areas
 *  in the registry. There is also an option to trigger direct feedback, 
 *  hence bypassing the registry.
 *
 *  Feedback areas must always be related to some UI Control (derived
 *  from CCoeControl). Areas are distinguished from each other based on
 *  control's address and an index number (so that it is possible
 *  to register and maintain multiple areas for same control).
 *
 *  Clients must add, maintain and remove their feedback areas using this
 *  API according to the state changes of the application / control, and
 *  according to for e.g. device wide layout changes.
 *
 *  There are two cases when tactile framework automatically updates the
 *  feedback areas for control: Feedback is always disabled when control
 *  becomes dimmed and re-enabled when control becomes undimmed again.
 *  If control becomes invisible, then feedback areas are (temporarily)
 *  removed, and they will be automatically added again when control
 *  becomes visible again.
 *
 *  This class is not intended for derivation outside the library.
