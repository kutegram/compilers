/**
* Class used to query which features are suppported in the environment. 
* Feature Discovery API provides methods which are used to query which
* features are supported in the environment. A feature is a functionality that
* can be optionally left out of some product configurations. Features often 
* depend on the underlying hardware. For example, MMC support or USB support
* can be features. The API consist of the CFeatureDiscovery class which is 
* used together with feature IDs defined in the featureinfo.h file.
*
*
* Usage:
*
* @code
*  #include <FeatDiscovery.h>
*  #include <featureinfo.h> // for feature definitions
*
*  // If querying only one feature, it is more efficient to use the class
*  // via the static method, IsFeatureSupportedL().
*  // When querying more than one feature, it is more efficient to use the 
*  // class by creating an instance and calling the IsSupported() method.
*
*  // Static way of using the class:
*  TBool isSupported = CFeatureDiscovery::IsFeatureSupportedL(KFeatureIdUsb);
*
*  // Dynamic way of using the class using NewL():
*  
*  // Call NewL() to create an instance of CFeatureDiscovery. 
*  CFeatureDiscovery* testA = CFeatureDiscovery::NewL();
* 
*  // Call the exported IsSupported() method to query whether features 
*  // are supported in the current environment or not.
*  TBool usbSupported = testA->IsSupported(KFeatureIdUsb);
*  TBool mmcSupported = testA->IsSupported(KFeatureIdMmc);
*
*  // Delete the created instance of CFeatureDiscovery.
*  delete testA;
*
*  // Dynamic way of using the class using NewLC():
* 
*  // Call NewLC() to create an instance of CFeatureDiscovery.
*  // The method leaves the instance of the object on the cleanup stack.
*  CFeatureDiscovery* testB = CFeatureDiscovery::NewLC();
*
*  // Call the exported IsSupported() method to query whether features 
*  // are supported in the current environment or not. 
*  TBool wcdmaSupported = testB->IsSupported(KFeatureIdProtocolWcdma);
*  TBool gsmSupported = testB->IsSupported(KFeatureIdProtocolGsm);
*
*  // Pop and delete the created instance of CFeatureDiscovery.
*  CleanupStack::PopAndDestroy();
* @endcode
