/**

*
*  Class for managing SIP refresh.
*  It provides functions for getting associated sip transaction
*  and state. Class also provides functions for updating and terminating 
*  stand-alone refreshes.
*
*  Note that only stand-alone refreshes (i.e. refreshes that are not associated
*  with registration binding or dialog associations) can be terminated or
*  updated using functions defined in this class.
