/**
*  Class describes some IdentityProvider service
*  Class is intented to be used when registrating
*  information about some identity providing service.
*  In case of ID-WSF framework, the IdentityProvider
*  and Authentication Service are behind same endpoint.
*  Typically, ID-WSF service consumers call both
*  RegisterIdentityProviderL() and 
*  RegisterServiceDescriptionL() methods as defined
*  in Service Management API (CSenServiceManager).
*  Basic Web Service consumers use this class to register
*  BASIC-AUTH credentials to certain pre-known service endpoint.
