        * Two-phased constructor. Leaves on failure.
        * This function shall be used to create the access point 
        * settings/selection handling UI object. It is customizable through 
        * the parameters. This object is a small layer above the UI part and
        * it provides a standard interface to select, edit, create access 
        * points. It has two main parts, Select and Edit. The first parameter,
        * aStartWithSelection gives whether we would like to select or edit.
        * In case of selection, there is the possibility to use this module in
        * many applications. For this, two layouts are implemented, 
        * one is list pane used by General Settings which provides the list in
        * a list-pane. The other layout is for the other applications 
        * requiring access point selection, a popup-list style as the decision
        * I know about was that General Settings will use list-pane and all
        * other apps. popup-list style. It is the caller who selects the style
        * so if spec. says otherwise, this module still can be used.
        * It is also possible to start the UI without selection, so if any 
        * module has a 'linked/default/etc.' access point and stored it's UID,
        * the module can simply call the editor part of the UI without having
        * to select the AP once more. In case of editing only, 
        * (aStartWithSelection is EFalse), all other construction parameters 
        * are ignored and after construction caller can simply call 
        * RunSettingsL(..). In case of selection, a lot of other parameters 
        * can be specified to fulfil all requirements. There are three types 
        * of Options menu available: 
        * EApSettingsSelMenuNormal, 
        * EApSettingsSelMenuSelectOnly,
        * EApSettingsSelMenuSelectNormal.
        * <br>
        *-EApSettingsSelMenuSelectOnly: Only Select is visible,

        * <br>

        *                               Settings, contains Edit, Delete, 
        *                               Create new, etc. menu items.
        * <br>

        *                                BUT the first item is Select. 
        *                                This one makes it possible to select 
        *                                an access point and also possible to 
        *                                edit, create, delete, etc.
        * <br>
        * The following three parameters specify the filtering and ordering 
        * criteria for the selection list creation. First, it is possible to
        * specify which ISP-type we are looking for. The possible values are:
        * <br>
        * KEApIspTypeInternetOnly:  Filter allows only access points that are
        *                           capable of only internet access.

        * KEApIspTypeInternetAndWAP: Filter allows only access points that are
        *                           capable of internet AND WAP access.

        * The following three parameters specify the filtering and ordering
        * criteria for the selection list creation. First, it is possible to 
        * specify which ISP-type we are looking for. The possible values are:
        * <br>
        * KEApIspTypeInternetOnly: Filter allows only access points that are 
        *   capable of only internet access.
        * <br>
        * KEApIspTypeWAPOnly: Filter allows only access points that are 
        *   capable of only WAP access.
        * <br>
        * KEApIspTypeInternetAndWAP: Filter allows only access points that are 
        *   capable of internet AND WAP access.
        * <br>
        * KEApIspTypeWAPMandatory: Filter allows only access points that are 
        *   capable of WAP access AND contain mandatory WAP settings.
        * <br>
        * KEApIspTypeAll: No filtering is done for the isp-type, all types of
        *   access points are shown.
        * <br>
        * It is possible to combine them by simply adding/or-ing together the
        * values, filtering will be done in such a way that only access points
        * with the listed ISP-types will be shown. Second filtering possibility
        * (aBearerFilter) is the desired bearer type. The possible values are 
        * the values of the TApBearerType enum type and their combinations, as
        * in case of the ISP type. The ordering of the list can be specified 
        * with the aSortType parameter. It can have the following values:
        * KEApSortUidAscending: The sorting is done according to the ID of 
        *   the access points in ascending order.
        * KEApSortUidDescending: The sorting is done according to the ID of 
        *   the access points in descending order.
        * KEApSortNameAscending: The sorting is done according to the name of
        *   the access points in ascending order.
        * KEApSortNameDescending: The sorting is done according to the name of
        *   the access points in descending order.
        * Caution! The ordering values can not be combined!
