/**
* The class used to control the device lights.
*
* The HW Resource Manager Light API is a library API providing the ability 
* to control the various light targets of the device. The API provides also
* methods to retrieve the current light status and the supported light targets
* of the device. The API is meant for all applications which need to control 
* lights of the device.
*
* Type of the HW Resource Manager Light API is a synchronous method call meaning 
* the method call will block the client application. Every new call of the light
* API method stops all ongoing light control orders. Light state after duration
* based orders expire is the state specified by the last non-duration based order. 
*
* The API consist of the classes CHWRMLight and MHWRMLightObserver. If the client
* requires up-to-date status information, it should also provide callback pointer
* of the MHWRMLightObserver implementing class for the NewL-method.
*
* Usage:
*
* @code
* #include <HWRMLight.h>  // link against HWRMLightClient.lib
*
* // A CHWRMLight instance can be created by using NewL() or NewLC() methods. 
* // Up-to-date status information not required, no callbacks.
* CHWRMLight* light = CHWRMLight::NewL();
*
* // After this, lights can be directly controlled via the provided class methods. 
* light-> LightOnL (EPrimaryDisplay, 5000); // Turn display lights on for five seconds.
* light->LightOffL(EPrimaryDisplay); // Turn display lights off indefinitely.
*
* // To clean up, delete the created object:
* delete light;
* @endcode
*
* @lib HWRMLIGHTCLIENT.DLL
* @since S60 3.0
