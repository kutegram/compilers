/**
* Defines condition type.

* Conditions can be standalone conditions or a part of a two-part condition.
* 
* - ESensrvLimitCondition is a standalone condition which has a limit. This kind of condition
*   is met when the observed value exceeds or equals the condition value, depending on the
*   operator used in the condition.
* - ESensrvRangeConditionLowerLimit is the first part of a two-part range condition. This kind
*   of condition is met when the observed value is between specified lower and upper limits or
*   beyond specified range, depending on the operators used in the two conditions that make up
*   the range.
*   A condition set that contains ESensrvRangeConditionLowerLimit condition must also contain
*   ESensrvRangeConditionUpperLimit condition using the same index. Both lower and upper limit
*   operators must have different direction, i.e. if lower limit has "less than" operator, then
*   upper limit must have "greater than" operator, and vice versa. ESensrvOperatorEquals operator
*   is not valid for range condition.
* - ESensrvRangeConditionUpperLimit is the second part of a two-part range condition.
* - ESensrvBinaryCondition is used for channels that provide bitmask values (typically event
*   channels). ESensrvOperatorBinaryXxx operations can only be used with this condition type.

/*
* Defines condition operator
* 
* For a range condition a ConditionSet must contain 2 Conditions each with an operator in a
* different direction. i.e. There must be matching greater than and less than pair. Also the pair
* of conditions must have the same index in the ConditionSet.
* 
* - ESensrvOperatorEquals checks if the value got from the sensor is equal to the set value. This is
*   not a valid operator for a range condition.
* - ESensrvOperatorGreaterThan checks if the value got from the sensor is greater than the set limit. 
*   This is not a valid operator for a binary condition.
* - ESensrvOperatorGreaterThanOrEquals checks if the value got from the sensor is greater than or equal
*   to the set limit. This is not a valid operator for a binary condition.
* - ESensrvOperatorLessThan checks if the value got from the sensor is less than the set limit. This is
*   not a valid operator for a binary condition.
* - ESensrvOperatorLessThanOrEquals checks if the value got from the sensor is less than or equal to the
*   set limit. This is not a valid operator for a binary condition.
* - ESensrvOperatorBinaryAnd checks if a bitmask data value got from the sensor has set at least one of
*   the bits set in the condition value. In other words, if result of datavalue & conditionvalue != 0,
*   there is a match. This is not a valid operator for a single limit or range conditions.
* 
*   Example: 
*   Condition value: 01101101
*   Data value:      10001010
*   Resulting value: 00001000 -> Non-zero, which indicates a match.
* - ESensrvOperatorBinaryAll checks if a bitmask data value got from the sensor has set all of the bits
*   set in the condition value. The rest of the data value bits are ignored. In other words, if
*   datavalue & conditionvalue == conditionvalue, there is a match. Not a valid operator for a single limit
*   or range conditions.
*   Example: 
*   Condition value: 01101101
*   Data value:      10001010
*   Resulting value: 00001000 -> Not equal to condition value -> Not a match.

// CLASS DECLARATION

/**
* CSensrvChannelCondition represents a channel condition item. Channel conditions are added to a channel
* condition set. A channel condition set is met when all channel conditions are met at the same time, if it
* is AND-type set, or when single condition is met if it is OR-type set. Only one channel condition can be
* set for each data item in single channel condition set. Certain condition types (range conditions) require
* two condition objects (upper and lower limit) in a condition set for the set to be valid. The pair of
* conditions must both have the same index in the condition set and they are considered a single channel
* condition. 
* 
* Each Condition has an ItemIndex associated with it. When a Condition is added to a Condition Set using
* CSensrvChannelConditionSet::AddChannelConditionL() this index must be different to all other conditions
* added to the set with the exception of range conditions as described above. If the index supplied already
* exists and the condition is not part of a range condition then
* CSensrvChannelConditionSet::AddChannelConditionL() leaves with KErrArgument.
