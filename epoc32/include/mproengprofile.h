/**
*  Profile settings interface.

*  and profile name interface.
*  How to use:
*  @code
*  // Get active profile with MProEngEngine::ActiveProfileL().
*  MProEngProfile* profile = iProfileEngine->ActiveProfileL();
*
*  // Use profile object here...
*
*  // When you are ready, free resources with MProEngProfile::Release()
*  profile->Release();
*
*  // If you release resources in destructor then:
*  if( iProfile )
*      {
*      iProfile->Release();
*      }
*
*  // If you put this class to CleanupStack then use void CleanupReleasePushL()
*  CleanupReleasePushL( *profile );
*  @endcode
