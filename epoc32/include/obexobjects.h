/**
This class is a concrete derivation of the CObexBaseObject class. Use it to 
store and transfer OBEX objects with the body part stored in an EPOC file. 
Hence this class is particularly suited to OBEX "file" beaming applications 
(c.f. arbitrary object beaming), although there is in reality no 
restriction in what it is used to transfer. Access to the body is acheived 
through an additional attribute to the object; the data file. This is the 
file-system name of the file used to store the body of the object. Note 
that there is no explicit relation between this and the Name of the object, 
although it is expected that most applications would attempt to relate the 
two.

When ever a valid data file is set (i.e. DataFile().Length > 0), this file 
is effectively open, hence stopping any other application from opening it 
with exclusive rights. Therefore, it is recommended that Reset () be called 
on the object as soon as it is no longer required, and definitely before 
(conceptually) passing ownership of the data file to any other object or 
user.

CObexFileObject is also suited to situations where an object is expected to 
be received, but no information about the purpose of this object is known. 
This is due to CObexFileObject’s ability to create temporary files "on the 
fly" to store received data into, when a specific file is not provided by 
the application.

This class is not designed for user derivation.

/**
Use this class to hold objects where the body part is stored in a CBufFlat
object. Please note that although parameters are supplied as CBufBase objects,
non-CBufFlat parameters are not supported and will have unpredictable results.
At no point does the CObexBufObject create, or take ownership of any CBaseBuf
object it uses - it is always the responsibility of the creator/owner of the
CBaseBuf to free it when no longer required.

As this class does not take ownership of the buffers it uses, it equally can
not create its own buffers ad-hoc for storing new data into. Hence at no 
time is it valid for a CObexBufObject to exist with out it having a valid 
data buffer set. If such a situation arises, where it is required that 
received information should be discarded, consider using a CObexNullObject.

It is also posible to supply a file instead of a memory buffer, or to supply
both.  This functionality is due to the MObexServerNotify class expecting to
work only on CObexBufObjects, so CObexFileObjects cannot be returned from the
upcalls.
To use a file for body storage, call NewL() passing in a NULL pointer, then
call SetDataBufL() manually afterwards.  There are three overloads---to allow
purely memory based objects, purely file based, or a hybrid.  The hybrid object
buffers into a memory buffer (which is not allowed to grow), then writes data
to the file when the buffer is full.  The buffering behaviour can therefore be
tuned to the application by setting the size of the buffer prior to use.

This class is not designed for user derivation.
