/**
*  Executes the operation synchronously and then deletes it.
*
*  All functions which return a @ref CPosLmOperation object can be run
*  incrementally. If the client is not interested in running it
*  incrementally, it can call @ref CPosLmOperation::ExecuteL to run the
*  whole operation in one batch. This can be simplified by using
*  @ref ExecuteAndDeleteLD. It runs the operation and deletes the object
*  when it is done.
*
*  For instance, to use this function for
*  @ref CPosLandmarkDatabase::InitializeL, the client would call
*
*  ExecuteAndDeleteLD( database->InitializeL() );
*
*  The operation object should not be on the cleanup stack when this function
*  is called.
*
*  @since S60 3.0
*  @param aOperation The operation to handle. It will be deleted when the
*   function returns.

/**
*  Base class for handles to landmark operations.
*
*  Long running operations in the Landmarks API returns an object of this class
*  so that the client can run it incrementally and check the progress of the
*  operation.
*
*  The operation must explicitly be run by the client. The operation can
*  be run incrementally by calling @ref NextStep until it does not return
*  the status @p KPosLmOperationNotComplete. Alternately the operation can be
*  run synchronously by calling @ref ExecuteL.
*
*  @ref ExecuteAndDeleteLD can be used to handle the operation object if
*  it is run in synchronous mode.

        * When the operation has finished, this function will complete with
        * status @p KErrNone if the operation was successful, or an error code
        * if some error was encountered.
        *
        * This function also returns a progress of the operation. Progress is a
        * floating point number in the interval [0.0,1.0]. 0.0 indicates that
        * the operation has not started and 1.0 indicates that the operation
        * has completed.

        * progress may not be set when the function returns. They are only
