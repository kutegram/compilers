* Class for managing SIP NOTIFY dialog associations.
* It provides services for creating, using and
* terminating SIP NOTIFY dialog associations. The user can have multiple
* NOTIFY dialog associations per same SIP dialog.
* Implementation handles SUBSCRIBE on the dialog level defined by Call-Id,
* local and remote tags; user is responsible for "Event" and
* "Subscription-State" header semantics.
