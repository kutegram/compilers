A session can have only one send stream.

Only one packet can be sent at any one time.
Once a packet has been sent, the packet cannot be closed and no further packets
can be sent until an event signalling the completion of the send operation has
occurred. This will be one of the events defined by the enum values:
ERtpSendSucceeded and ERtpSendFail.

A client must monitor these events so that it can schedule the sending of
subsequent packets.
It does this by implementing and registering callback functions that 
handle these events.

An event is generated when anything happens that a client might want

1. An event type as defined by a TRtpEventType value.
2. Additional information whose meaning is dependent on the event type.

Additional information may be implicitly associated with the event, but still
needs to be fetched from another object, for example, when processing
an ERtpPacketReceived event, the packet (represented by a RRtpReceivePacket
handle) must be obtained from the receive stream (represented by a
RRtpReceiveStream handle).

Events are always associated with either an RTP session, a send stream or
a receive stream, and this class has functions for getting the corresponding
handle.
