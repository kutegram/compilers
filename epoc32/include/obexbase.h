This class is the common base class for CObexClient and CObexServer. It is 
an abstract class and cannot be instantiated in itself. However, it does 
contain user functionality common to both client and server connections.

Provides the basic OBEX transport functionality (sending and receiving 
files)
Client and server provide the more specialied APIs for
- initiation or response to puts & gets
- (possible) handling of more generalised 'objects' (prob. with data buffered through a file).

This class is not designed for user derivation
